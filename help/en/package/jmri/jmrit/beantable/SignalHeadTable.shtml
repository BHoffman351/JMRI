<p>All the Signal Heads that JMRI knows about can be referenced
using the "Signal Head Table" tool in the Tools menu of most JMRI programs. Signal Heads are also referenced to build Signal Masts in a later step.
There are eight columns in the Signal Head Table:
	<ol>
	<li>The System Name is assigned to the Signal Head when it's created, 
	and can't be changed later.
	<li>If you're interested in having your Signal Heads carry "human readable"
	names, you can doubleclick in the "User Name" column and change that information
	to whatever you want.
	<li>As the Signal Head changes, for whatever reason, the current
	Appearance will show in the table in the "State" column.  You can also click on a
	State button to cycle through the available appearances:
	Red, Yellow, Green, Flashing red, Flashing Yellow, Flashing Green, and Dark.
	Some Signal Heads may also have Lunar and Flashing Lunar available.
	<li> The "Comment" column is for your use to record any comment you may want
	to help keep track of your Signal Heads. It is for information only. Doubleclick to edit the contents.
	<li>Click the "Delete" button in a specific row to delete the Signal Head. 
	Be sure to first remove any Signal Head icons associated with this Signal Head,
	any associated Simple Signal Logic,
	and all references to this Signal Head. Use this button with caution!
	<li>The check box in the "Lit" column lets you control whether the
	Signal Head on the layout is lit (checked) or stays dark (unchecked).
	<li>The check box in the "Held" column shows the "held" property of the
	Signal Head, and allows you to change it.  This property is used by e.g. CTC
	machine logic to say "Don't change this Signal Head from red, even if it 
	would be safe to do so, because I want to hold a train here".
	<li>Click the "Edit" button in a row to view or change optional information
		for a Signal Head.<br/>
		Notes: System Name and Signal type cannot be changed. Only one 
	Signal Head may be edited at a time.
	</ol>
		
<p>To define a new Signal Head, click on the 
	"<a href="SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add.."</a> button at the bottom of the Signal Head Table.
It will prompt you for the Signal Head connection type and whatever information is needed.
	
<p> Use the Store item in the File menu to save signal information to disk. 
This information is saved with the configuration in an XML file, along
with control panel setup and similar stuff.  To store your panels in the same 
file (recommended), select <b>File > Store > Store Configuration and Panels To 
File...</b> or select <b>Panels > Save Panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.
<p>For more information on creating and displaying panels, including how to 
show signals on your panels, please see the 
<a href="../../../../html/apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels pages</a>.
