<h1>The LRoutes Table</h1>

<p>An LRoute is a more generalized version of a Route implemented as a Logix.
It is intended for use in situations where additional triggers or actions are
desired beyond the capabilities of Routes. It can be used as a starting point for
creating new Logix. The LRoutes table provides pick lists of Sensors, Turnouts, 
Lights, Signal Masts and Signal Heads from which output actions and trigger conditions can be 
chosen.</p>

<p>Once you have some Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads and/or Lights to manage, use 
the <b>Add...</b> button in the lower left hand corner of the LRoutes Table pane to
create a new Logix Route.  After you have created a Logix Route, you may add additional 
capabilities by editing it from the Logix Table.</p>

<p>The Logix that implements the LRoute has its system name prefixed with "RTX".
All Logix with this prefix are displayed in the LRoutes Table.  Please note that an
"RTX" Logix that has had capabilities added with 
Logix editing may not be able to display
these addtional capabilities for LRoute editing.  Once Logix editing is done to an
LRoute, it is recommended that further editing be done from the Logix Table.</p>

<h2>LRoute Table Columns</h2>

<DL>
	<DT>System Name</DT>
	<DD>The System Name cannot be changed once entered into the table.
